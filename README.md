This repository contains the code examples from the book https://toungafranck.com/elasticsearch-3/

When do I need them?
Because it's nice to have some sample data to run various searches from the book's samples. Throughout most chapters, there's an example use-case of running a get-together site, where you have people organizing themselves into groups and hosting events. Code samples provide you with some data and a script to index that data.

How do I index the sample data?
# clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ftounga/elasticsearch.git

# index the sample data
elasticsearch/populate.sh
I have questions or suggestions for these samples
You have feedback? We'd be glad to hear it from you on the book's forum. You can also send pull requests or open issues on this repository.

Happy reading and Elasticsearch-ing!
